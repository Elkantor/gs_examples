        How to do backends? Need emscripten/glfw platform backends + opengl3/opengles2/opengles3 backends
        Do I supply glfw backends? Or have them as added utilities that can be used?
        Don't get rid of glfw backend until all native backends are instated.

        Then in some user config file, define what you want to use? Or should it be solely project based?

        gs_config.h

        // Defines for implementation

        #define GS_PLATFORM_CUSTOM  // For custom platform implementation
        
        #define GS_GRAPHICS_CUSTOM  // For custom graphics implementation
